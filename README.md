# cmsacamp_baseball_project
This is our project for Carnegie Mellon's 2021 CMSACamp. This project began with one central question: can we prescribe a launch angle to players based on their power profile? It progressed into an analysis of a player's attack angle (or swing plane) and how changing this might affect their output as measured by wOBA.

Please see the final code folder for everything we did for this project in a concise fashion. How we loaded the data from statcast can be seen in the public_data folder. After this, the files should be viewed in this order: Final_EDA, Density_per_Player, Creating_GAMs, Tuning_Final_GAM, Chng_Launch_Angle_Function, Joint_Probabilities, Adjusting_Attack_Angles
