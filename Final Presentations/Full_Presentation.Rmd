## Motivation

- Two of the most popular stats in the MLB have recently been launch angle and exit velocity 

  - We wondered: can we prescribe a wOBA maximizing launch angle for an individual player 
  based on their power profile?
--

## First, a few definitions: 

- **wOBA** stands for weighted on base percentage.
  - We are only looking at batted balls (meaning no walks or hit-by-pitches) in this project, because that is what we have launch angle and exit velocity data on.
    - Each of the types of batted balls (out, single, double, triple, homers) are given a value - 0, 0.9, 1.25, 1.6, 2 - respectively

- **Launch angle** means the vertical angle that the ball leaves a playerâ€™s bat after making contact. 

- **Exit velocity** measures the speed (in mph) the ball comes off the bat. 

---
## Data

- The majority of our analysis uses 2019 MLB data from Baseball Savant
- Variables
  - Focus on modeling **wOBA** using **launch angle** and **exit velocity**
  - Other relevant variables we looked at during the exploratory process include **batter handedness, 
  pitcher handedness, infield alignment, pitch type, at-bat outcome, location of where the ball was fielded**
- Data is structured on a pitch-by-pitch basis

### Now how can we model these player recommendations? 

.pull-left[
- We will fit a **Generalized Additive Model, or GAM**, to **launch angle** and 
**exit velocity** with the target **wOBA**

  - GAMs have the ability to model complex *non-linear and non-monotonic* relationships between predictors and response variables, such as we see when we smooth the relationship between predictors **exit velocity** and **launch angle** with **wOBA**.

### We further evaluated our model by taking the following steps 

1) Compared our interaction model to the original additive model and a model with tensor 
smoothing using predictions from **5 five fold cross validation** and graphing the **RMSEs**.

2) Tuned our **k** to **200** with cross validation to find where the **decrease in RMSE for each model had plateaued**

  - Then used `gam.check()` to ensure the **k** we chose adequately represented to complexity of the relationship between variables. 

3) Checked the concurvity of the model to confirm no collinearity between launch angle and exit velocity. 

4) Created the following heatmap to understand which combinations of exit velocity and launch angle we have enough data on

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
vis.gam(x=woba_model2,  
        view = c("launch_angle", "launch_speed"), #variables
        plot.type = "contour", #kind of plot
        too.far = 0.05, #indicates what type of predictions should not be plotted because they are too far from the actual data, scaled from 0 to 1. The smaller the number, more area is not supported by data 
        nlevels = 20)
```

- Heyward consistently can reach the exit velocities of a power hitter! **He should increase his launch angle 15 degrees to 26 degrees**. 
  - With the potential for more home runs and doubles, making this change is expected to raise Heyward's wOBA *for balls in play* **from 0.377 to around 0.442**.

### What does our model recommend for Mike Trout?
.pull-left[
**Our original thoughts...**
- Based on **Mike Trout's** density plot, we didn't recommend any changes to his swing...he is a 3x MVP after all!

trout_density_2019 <- wOBA_by_LA_EV + stat_density2d(data = trout_stat_density, color = "white") +

**Our model's output...**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
result_trout <- read_rds("public_data/changing_LA_trout.rds")
knitr::kable(head(result_trout), format = 'html')
```

- Our model agrees that Mike Trout should not change his launch angle. 
  - The **true wOBA** and **predicted wOBA** differ above simply because the **predicted wOBA** is what our model predicted Trout's **ball-in-play wOBA** to be when it took in his batted ball data.

## Using a player's attack angle to predict launch angles
.pull-left[
- A player's **attack angle** is the angle that the barrel of the bat travels through impact with the baseball 

- The attack angle is calculated by taking the **median of the player's top 10% highest launch speeds**

- We then used this attack angle with pitch height to create a linear model which predicts a player's launch angles

## Using joint probabilities to maximize wOBA by changing attack angle

- Using this density we can randomly sample points to create a mock dataset of a player's hit-into-play balls for the season. 
  - We can find the wOBA for this dataset and adjust the attack angle as needed to find a maximum wOBA. 
---

## Adding in pitch height to find a maximum wOBA over different attack angles

- When adjusting a player's attack angle, our linear model gives us a set of new predicted launch angles for each ball hit into play

- Exit velocities were sampled to create a mock data set representing this player's balls hit into play due to their new attack angle

-This data was run though the wOBA model (GAM) to generate predictions of the player's potential production

# Looking forward to the effects on K% rate

- Sure, we can tell a player to increase or decrease their attack angle - but often times hitting with a steeper attack angle can be correlated with a higher strikeout rate, as seen in the graphs below. 

- Additionally, we see a higher correlation between **attack angle and K%** (0.313) than **launch angle and K%** (0.179). 

  - This further supports our reasoning to make recommendations for a players based on their **attack angle**, rather than **average launch angle**.

### Next Steps: for the long term we are interested in...

- Better quantifying the relationship between attack angle and strikeout percentage

- Understanding and quantifying how hard it is for a player to change their launch angle 

  - Baseball is a mental game - are players' mental states negatively impacted when changing their swing? 
  
    - What wOBA increase is worth risking messing with a player's mental state? 
  
- If a player does change their attack angle pitchers will begin to pitch to them differently - our methods assume they are given the exact same set of pitches which is unrealistic.
